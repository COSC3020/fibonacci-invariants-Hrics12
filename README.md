# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

For the fib() function the invariant would be that at the start of each recurisive call the array contains the correct Fib sequence up to the $ith$ index. This is true becasue at the start when $i$ equals 2, the array has the correct fib sequnce [0,1]. The at the start of the 2nd on beyond recursive call the array updates the value $i$ with the sum of the preceding numbers using $fibArray[i-1]+ fibArray[i-2]$


I have no idea why this is continuing to fail. I've changed the base case from my original, i've set it to start from index 0 and 1. I have no clue what the issue is. Even my original function is recursive and storing the outputs in an array.

```javascript
function fib(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return Array(n).fill(1);
    let fibArray = [1, 1];
    function helper(i) {
        if (i === n) return;
        fibArray[i] = fibArray[i - 1] + fibArray[i - 2];
        helper(i + 1);
    }
    helper(2);
    return fibArray;
}
let result = fib(7);
console.log(result);
```
